SFU-Snap

This project has a full experiences of a completed cycle of the user-centered design (UCD) process, including requirements gathering, prototyping, and evaluation.

There are three parts in this group project. In the first part, we are going to conduct a HeuristicEvaluation on an interface and specify design requirements. 
In the second part, we are going to create prototypes implementing the design requirements you came up with.
In the third part, we are going to evaluate your design, provide recommendations for improvement, and reflect on the process.

The interface belongs to SFU Snap, a platform that is designed for students of SFU by students of SFU, for them to keep with all the latest updates on campus.

Our task is to implement a feature for SFU Snap that allows students to communicate with each other by adding a design that is effective in bringing students togehter. 

The second and third part of our project contains prototypes that would help us to create our design.
